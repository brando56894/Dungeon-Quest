# Dungeon-Quest
This was a game I had originally created as a final project for my Python class at Rutgers University in New Brunswick,  NJ.
I had converted it to Java and then a GUI game using the Swing library. Sadly over the years I had lost the code and decided to 
recreate it while I was re-learning Python.

This branch uses classes for the player, monster and attack parts of the game. The original version (in Master) does not use classes, but global variables instead. It works but is not feature complete (no fighting system) and will live on just for my reference.
