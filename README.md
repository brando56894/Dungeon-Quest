# Dungeon-Quest

This is a roll and move style game I had originally created as a final project for my Python class at Rutgers University in New Brunswick,  NJ.
With the help of Masa-Yume, it has morphed into something more complex than I could have ever imagined.

####Dependencies
* dill (obtained via pip)

The current features are as follows:

* A shop where the player can purchase items, weapons, armor, and skills
* Player finds random items such as gold, health potions and weapons as (s)he is navigating the dungeon
* Random monster attack with multiple types of monsters which have different health, offense and defense attributes
* Many types of weapons: melee, spells and ranged weapons
* Mid-game boss and Final boss
* Interactive, turn based attack system
* Player gains experience based upon which monster was killed, will be used later for leveling up character
* Save and load features

To start the game simply execute main.py with Python v2.x (preferably 2.7.x), the game will not work at all with Python 3
