# Dungeon-Quest

This was a roll and move style game I had originally created as a final project for my Python class at Rutgers University in New Brunswick,  NJ.
I had converted it to Java and then a GUI game using the Swing library. Sadly over the years I had lost the code and decided to 
recreate it while I was re-learning Python, and make it better than it ever was before since we never learned about classes.

The current features are as follows:

* A shop where the player can purchase health potions and better weapons
* Player finds random items such as gold, health potions and weapons as (s)he is navigating the dungeon
* Random monster attack with 2 types of monsters (Big and Small) which have different attributes
* Mid-game boss and Final boss
* Non-interactive attack system (only initially gives you the choice to fight or run away, all other turns are automated)
* Player gains experience based upon which monster was killed, will be used later for leveling up character
